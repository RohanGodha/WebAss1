                <li>This 1963 classic by Irish-born American minister Joseph Murphy (1898-1981) strongly influenced the New Thought, New Age and self-help movements.</li><li>Its brief chapters offer a clear, engaging and encouraging treatise on how to lead a better life, forge better relationships, become more prosperous and improve your health.</li><li>Murphy repeats some points in different chapters, and his vocabulary and reasoning may seem odd or casual.</li><li>For example, he groups all the functions of the autonomic nervous system as part of the subconscious.</li><li>Some of his scientific assertions weren’t standard findings when the book came out, and now more of its science has become outdated (well, it’s been a while), so step in for the mindfulness and guidance he offers, not the hard data. getAbstract finds that his philosophical approach will interest anyone with a New Age bent and those seeking calmness through a blending of psychology and spirituality.
